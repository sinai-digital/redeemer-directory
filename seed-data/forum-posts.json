Life in the Spirit vs. life in the flesh (v. 1-11)\n2. Our adoption as children of God (v. 12-17)\n3. Future glory and present suffering (v. 18-30)\n4. Nothing can separate us from God's love (v. 31-39)\n\n## Discussion Questions\n- What does it mean practically to \"set your mind on the Spirit\" in daily life?\n- How does the promise of Romans 8:28 sustain you during difficult seasons?\n- Which verse in this chapter resonates most with you right now, and why?\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts, questions, or insights below.
